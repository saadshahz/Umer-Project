# Problem Statement

**Teacher's Requirement:**
Design an HR assistant that helps a recruiter quickly see how well a candidate’s CV matches a specific advertised job. The system should:
1.  Accept a **CV** and a **Job Description (JD)**.
2.  Extract key elements: **Skills**, **Experience**, and **Qualifications**.
3.  Compute a simple **match indication** (Percentage score or Low/Medium/High).
4.  Highlight main reasons: **Strong overlaps** and **Missing key skills**.
5.  Be a **minimal tool** for initial screening.
